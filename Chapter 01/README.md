- `Chapter 01 Walkthrough.ipynb` is the original (maybe slightly modified)
- `Chapter_01_java.ipynb` is a Java notebook on the same topic
- `chap01.Section01.java` is the pure Java version on the Java Notebook

For the graphics in Java, we use [`XChart`](https://knowm.org/open-source/xchart).

> Note: the jar at the roo level (`System-Languages-1.0.jar`) is generated from `ProjectTrunk/System-Languages`
> in the `raspberry-coffee` repo.
